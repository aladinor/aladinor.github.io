### A bit about me...

🌧️ PhD (c) in the [CLiMAS](https://climas.illinois.edu/) Department at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/?utm_source=Illinois_App&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=Header)

📡 Radar Meteorology & Cloud Physics

🤖 Machine Learning for Weather

🌍 Open Science & FAIR Data

💾 Big Data & Building AI-ready Datasets

:::

::::

I work extensively with [raw2zarr](https://github.com/aladinor/raw2zarr) for cloud-optimized radar data, contribute to [xradar](https://github.com/openradar/xradar) and the [Open Radar Science](https://openradarscience.org/) community, and develop tools for GPM validation networks.
