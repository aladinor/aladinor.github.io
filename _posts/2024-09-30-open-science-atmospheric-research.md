Open science represents more than just making research papers freely available - it's about fundamentally transforming how we conduct, share, and build upon scientific knowledge. In atmospheric research, where phenomena transcend national boundaries and require global cooperation, open science practices are not just beneficial but essential.

## Breaking Down Barriers

Having worked in both operational meteorology in Colombia and academic research in the United States, I've witnessed firsthand how open science practices can bridge the gap between different research environments and resource levels.

### The Colombian Experience

Working with IDEAM (Colombian National Weather Service) highlighted several challenges common to meteorological services in developing countries:

- **Limited access** to expensive proprietary software and datasets
- **Isolation** from international research communities due to language and economic barriers  
- **Brain drain** as talented meteorologists migrate to better-resourced institutions
- **Technology gaps** in accessing and processing modern atmospheric datasets

### Open Solutions, Global Impact

Open science practices offer powerful solutions to these challenges...

## Building Inclusive Communities

One of the most rewarding aspects of open science work has been contributing to educational initiatives that make atmospheric science tools accessible globally...

## The Path Forward

As we look toward the future of atmospheric research, several trends are reshaping how we approach open science...
