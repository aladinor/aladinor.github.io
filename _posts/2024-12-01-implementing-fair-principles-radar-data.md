The management of weather radar data has evolved dramatically over the past decade, driven by increasing data volumes, growing international collaboration needs, and the push toward open science practices. In this post, I'll share insights from implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for Colombian weather radar data and how these practices can benefit the global meteorological community.

## The Challenge of Weather Radar Data

Weather radar systems generate enormous amounts of data daily - the Colombian national radar network alone produces several terabytes of observations each day. Traditional data management approaches often result in:

- **Fragmented Archives**: Data scattered across different systems and formats
- **Limited Accessibility**: Barriers to data access for researchers and international collaborators  
- **Format Inconsistencies**: Multiple proprietary formats hindering interoperability
- **Metadata Gaps**: Incomplete documentation limiting data reusability

## FAIR Principles in Action

### Making Data Findable

The first step in our FAIR implementation involved creating comprehensive metadata standards and discovery systems...
