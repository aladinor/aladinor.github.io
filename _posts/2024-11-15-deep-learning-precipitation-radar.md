Measuring precipitation from space has been a cornerstone of global weather and climate monitoring for decades. However, traditional algorithms for retrieving rainfall information from satellite radar observations face fundamental limitations, particularly in accurately estimating particle size distributions that are crucial for understanding precipitation processes.

## The Dual-Frequency Advantage

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission's Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) provides unprecedented opportunities for precipitation science. By combining Ku-band (13.6 GHz) and Ka-band (35.5 GHz) radar measurements, we can probe different aspects of precipitation particle populations...

## Neural Network Innovation

Our research introduces a novel deep learning approach that leverages the complementary information from both radar frequencies to improve particle size distribution retrievals. The key innovations include:

- **Physics-Informed Architecture**: Neural network design that respects fundamental radar scattering principles
- **Multi-Scale Learning**: Capturing both local precipitation features and broader atmospheric patterns
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Providing confidence estimates alongside precipitation retrievals

## Impact on Weather and Climate

The improvements achieved through deep learning approaches have significant implications for...
