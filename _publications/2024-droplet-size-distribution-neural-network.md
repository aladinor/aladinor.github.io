abstract: |
  This study presents a novel approach for retrieving droplet size distributions from dual-frequency precipitation radar measurements using deep neural networks. The methodology leverages the complementary information provided by Ku-band and Ka-band radar frequencies to improve the accuracy of particle size distribution estimates compared to traditional retrieval algorithms.
