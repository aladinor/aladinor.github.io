# Profile Photo

Place your profile photo here as `profile.jpg`

Recommended specifications:
- Square aspect ratio (e.g., 500x500px or 1000x1000px)
- JPG or PNG format
- Good lighting and professional appearance
- File name: profile.jpg

The custom CSS will style it with:
- Border in Yale blue color
- Subtle shadow effect
- Hover animation

If you don't have a photo yet, the site will still build - you'll just see a broken image placeholder that you can replace later.
